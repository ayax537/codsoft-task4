ðŸ“£ Forth task on CodSoft Internship
During my internship at CodSoft, I had the opportunity to develop a Spam SMS Detection model. The goal was to create a machine-learning solution to classify SMS messages as "ham" or "spam" automatically.

Here's a summary of the project:

1. Explored and visualized the dataset to understand the distribution of "ham" and "spam" messages.
2. Preprocessed the dataset by applying text operations, token visualization, and TF-IDF method for feature extraction.
3. Selected and implemented the Naive Bayes model for classification.
4. Explored BERT and FLAN-T5 models for evaluation and comparison.

The project aimed to enhance SMS message filtering for improved user experience and privacy. It was a valuable learning experience, and I'm eager to continue exploring new opportunities in the tech industry.
